Using str_view() we can identify if the pattern exists in vdem_2022 dataframe.\n\nstr_view(vdem_2022$country_name, \"United States\")\n\n[16] │ &lt;United States&gt; of America\n\n\nNow, let’s see why there is no Kazakhstan. It is definitely missing! Probably, it was not yet ranked by V-Dem.\n\nvdem_2022 %&gt;%\n  filter(country_name == \"Kazakhstan\")\n\n  country_name year regime regime_categorical\n1   Kazakhstan 2022     NA               &lt;NA&gt;\n\n\nAll in all, these issues related to the most frequent reasons why data might be missing after merging:\n\n“Key” variables are spelled differently\nThe data is not available in one of the datasets\n\nWe’ll stick to removing NAs from the dataset using na.omit(). Check out tips in the end of the script to dig into other solutions to the problem of missing values.\n\nwhr_vdem = whr_vdem %&gt;% \n  na.omit()"
