It gets slightly trickier.\n\\[\n\\text{Arms Import} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(\\text{LogGDP}) + \\beta_2(\\text{International Conflict}) + \\beta_3(\\text{Regime})\n\\]\nAnd finally, interaction model. You can try to interpret the interaction, but we need to know the reference categories. Which is a bit of a hustle.\n\\[\n\\text{Arms Import} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(\\text{LogGDP}) + \\beta_2(\\text{International Conflict}) + \\beta_3(\\text{Regime}) + \\beta_4(\\text{LogGDP} \\times \\text{International Conflict})\n\\]"
