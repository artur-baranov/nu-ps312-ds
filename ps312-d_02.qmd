# Markdown and Quarto

This whole website was built using R, Markdown and Quarto. Let's quickly overview these languages

In RStudio, you can use Markdown language to format text. 

For example, **this is bold text** and *this is italic text*. And, of course, you can insert images. It's pretty easy, and after the class you can take a look at some [tutorials](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

You can do many-many more different things. In this regard, visual editor in RStudio might be helpful. Markdown is also used in several note taking apps, e.g. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) or [Notion](https://www.notion.so). Feel free to utilize your Markdown knowledge for your studies.

Generally, what we've done so far can be described by the image below. We have used R ("engine") and RStudio ("car"). In Rstudio we have Quarto, which is this document you are working with right now. We can do a lot of things right away -- e.g., render our output to a Word document, PDF or HTML.
